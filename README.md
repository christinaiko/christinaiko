Hi! I'm Christin. 

Transactional paralegal turned Data Professional. I spent nearly a decade in the legal field working with financial data and other highly sensitive/confidential information. However, I recently pivoted into DataOps and I will continue to treat data as if I were still bound by attorney-client privilege.

I currently work as a Data Operations Coordinator II - Workforce Analytics at Trusaic where I clean and analyze payroll data to determine compliance with Affordable Care Act laws.  The tech stack for this role is Excel and R.  We also use our own software which is an Alteryx-like platform to store and organize data.

I am currently upskilling in the following:<br/>
